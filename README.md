# Object Detection

This project implements real-time object detection using the YOLOv8 model from the Ultralytics library. It can process video files or webcam streams and displays detected objects with bounding boxes and class labels.

## Features
- Real-time object detection from video files or webcam.
- Displays bounding boxes around detected objects.
- Shows confidence scores and class names for each detection.
- Calculates and displays frames per second (FPS) for performance monitoring.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Ultralytics (YOLOv8)
- cvzone
- NumPy

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python ultralytics cvzone numpy
